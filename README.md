> This README provides an overview of my latest projects, the Webstack ReactJS Portfolio and the Ferrari Landing Page, demonstrating my skills in frontend development.
> - **ReactJS**: ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Its component-based architecture makes it easier to manage complex UIs by breaking them down into reusable and composable components. ReactJS also offers a virtual DOM for efficient rendering, allowing for faster updates and better performance.
> - **Vite**: Vite is a modern build tool for frontend development. It offers lightning-fast development and build times by leveraging native ES modules in the browser. With Vite, developers can enjoy near-instantaneous hot module replacement (HMR), quick server start times, and optimized production builds. It's a game-changer for modern web development workflows.
